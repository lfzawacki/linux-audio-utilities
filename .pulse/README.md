# .pulse

Custom configurations for my pulseaudio server

* **client.conf** : Makes it so that when pulse is killed it doesn't spawn back (useful for the recording scripts)
* **daemon.conf** : Disables global volume for pulseaudio, see https://fransdejonge.com/2015/10/pulseaudio-how-to-decouple-application-volumes-and-global-volume/
